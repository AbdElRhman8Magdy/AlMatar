🧰 **Tools & Libraries Used**
Playwright for browser automation

TypeScript for type safety

Jest-style Assertions

JSON for external test data abstraction

⚙ **Assumptions & Limitations**
This framework tests only happy-path flows.

Items added to Search are assumed to be added correctly utiles files.

No mocking or API-layer assertions are used—entirely UI-driven.
